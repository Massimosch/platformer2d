description="Thanks for Installing the Ovani Auto FootSteps plugin for Godot!
This Plugin adds two new Nodes:
 - The \"AutoFootSteps\" Node, Which will detect movement and
	the current floor type, and then play footstep SFX accordingly.
	(The automatic floor detection supports almost all 3D Collider
	 Setups by comparing Material and Texture names to a List of tags, 
	 and should be Plug-n-Play. If it isn't working immediately,
	 Double check the setup tutorial, or contact us on our discord for
	 free support! [discord.com/invite/7f56mSaqVM])
 - The \"FootMaterialTag\" Node, Which will override what material a
   surface will play.

Additionally, this plugin comes with Two \"FootStepProfiles\",
\"Shoe/Boot\" and \"Barefoot\". Specify which Profile to use in your
AutoFootSteps Node, or Create your own!"
